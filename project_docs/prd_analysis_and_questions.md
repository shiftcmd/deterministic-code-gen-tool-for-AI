# PRD Analysis and Questions

## Overview
This document captures key ambiguities, questions, and clarifications needed from the Python Debugging Utility PRD.

## Critical Ambiguities and Questions

### 1. Tool Selection and Integration
**Ambiguity**: The PRD mentions multiple parsing tools (AST, astroid, inspect4py, mypy, pylint, pyflakes) but doesn't specify the exact combination or integration strategy.

**Questions**:
- Which specific tools should be used in Phase 1 vs later phases?
- How should conflicting analysis results from different tools be resolved?
- Should we implement a plugin architecture for tools or hardcode the integration?

**Recommendation**: Start with AST + astroid + mypy for Phase 1, add others incrementally based on validation results.

### 2. Intent Tagging System Design
**Ambiguity**: The intent tagging system is described conceptually but lacks specific implementation details.

**Questions**:
- What is the exact syntax for intent tags? (decorators, comments, separate files?)
- How granular should intent tags be? (function-level, class-level, module-level?)
- Should intent tags be stored in code or external configuration?
- How do we handle intent tag versioning and migration?

**Current Understanding**: Based on ai_tagging_rules.md, it appears to use comment-based tags, but integration with the main analysis pipeline needs clarification.

### 3. AI Model Selection and Configuration
**Ambiguity**: Multiple AI models mentioned (GPT-4, Claude, local models) without clear selection criteria.

**Questions**:
- Which AI model should be the primary choice for domain classification?
- How should model fallback be handled?
- What are the specific prompting strategies for each analysis type?
- Should model selection be configurable per project?

### 4. Knowledge Graph Schema
**Ambiguity**: Neo4j integration mentioned but schema not fully specified.

**Questions**:
- What are the exact node types and relationships in the knowledge graph?
- How should code relationships be weighted and scored?
- What queries should be optimized for in the graph design?
- How do we handle graph updates when code changes?

### 5. Performance and Scalability
**Ambiguity**: Performance targets mentioned but not quantified for different project sizes.

**Questions**:
- What are acceptable analysis times for projects of different sizes (1K, 10K, 100K+ lines)?
- Should analysis be incremental or full-project each time?
- How should we handle memory usage for very large codebases?
- What are the hardware requirements for different deployment scenarios?

### 6. User Interface and Experience
**Ambiguity**: React frontend mentioned but specific UI/UX requirements not detailed.

**Questions**:
- What are the primary user workflows and screens needed?
- How should complex analysis results be visualized?
- What level of interactivity is needed in the knowledge graph visualization?
- Should there be different views for different user roles (architect vs developer)?

### 7. Data Storage and Versioning
**Ambiguity**: PostgreSQL for versioning mentioned but schema and versioning strategy not specified.

**Questions**:
- What granularity of versioning is needed (file-level, function-level, analysis-level)?
- How should analysis history be stored and queried?
- What are the data retention policies?
- How do we handle schema migrations for the database?

## Technical Clarifications Needed

### 1. Architecture Patterns
- Should the system follow a specific architectural pattern (hexagonal, clean architecture, etc.)?
- How should the different components (parser, AI, graph, storage) be decoupled?

### 2. Configuration Management
- What configuration options should be exposed to users?
- How should different analysis profiles be managed?
- Should configuration be per-project or global?

### 3. Error Handling and Resilience
- How should the system handle partial analysis failures?
- What recovery mechanisms are needed for long-running analyses?
- How should we handle malformed or unparseable code?

### 4. Security and Privacy
- What security measures are needed for AI model integration?
- How should sensitive code information be protected?
- Are there any compliance requirements (SOC2, GDPR, etc.)?

## Implementation Priority Questions

### Phase 1 Scope Clarification
**Question**: The PRD mentions Phases 1-3 as "Core Features" but doesn't clearly delineate what specifically belongs in Phase 1.

**Suggested Phase 1 Minimal Scope**:
1. Basic Python AST parsing
2. Simple domain classification (without AI initially)
3. Basic Neo4j graph generation
4. Minimal React frontend for project selection
5. File-based configuration (no PostgreSQL initially)

### Integration Strategy
**Question**: Should this be built as a monolithic application or microservices?

**Recommendation**: Start monolithic for Phase 1, design for microservices decomposition in later phases.

## Next Steps Required

1. **Technical Architecture Document**: Create detailed system architecture with component interactions
2. **API Specification**: Define internal APIs between components
3. **Database Schema Design**: Specify PostgreSQL and Neo4j schemas
4. **UI/UX Mockups**: Create wireframes for the React frontend
5. **Configuration Schema**: Define configuration file formats and options
6. **Testing Strategy**: Define unit, integration, and end-to-end testing approaches

## Assumptions Made

1. Target deployment is primarily on-premise or private cloud
2. Primary language support is Python 3.8+
3. Users have technical background (developers/architects)
4. Analysis can be asynchronous (not real-time)
5. Initial focus on static analysis before dynamic analysis
