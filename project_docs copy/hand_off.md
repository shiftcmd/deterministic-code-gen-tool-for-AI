## Current Focus: Error Handling and JSON Serialization for AST Parser

### Current Work

We are implementing robust error handling and JSON serialization capabilities for the AST Parser Engine (Task 2.7), following the development of the main parser plugin system and Neo4j exporter. This work is critical for ensuring the parser can gracefully handle malformed Python files, syntax errors, and plugin failures while providing meaningful error information to users. The serialization system enables proper storage, transfer, and export of parsed data structures, particularly for the Neo4j knowledge graph integration.

### Completed Work

1. **Error Handling Framework**
   - Created comprehensive error handling system in `backend/parser/errors.py`
   - Implemented error codes, severity levels, and contextual error information
   - Developed a `Result<T>` type for functional-style error handling
   - Built an `ErrorCollector` for aggregating errors during parsing operations

2. **JSON Serialization System**
   - Implemented circular reference detection and handling in `backend/parser/serialization.py`
   - Created a custom JSON encoder supporting dataclasses, enums, and complex Python types
   - Added path and datetime serialization support
   - Built the `ParsedDataSerializer` class with comprehensive serialization utilities

3. **Data Model Enhancement**
   - Updated all parser data models (`ParsedModule`, `ParsedClass`, `ParsedFunction`, `ParsedVariable`, etc.) to implement proper `to_dict()` methods
   - Ensured recursive data structures are correctly serialized

4. **Parser Plugin System Integration**
   - Enhanced the `ParserPlugin` base class to incorporate error handling
   - Updated plugin registration and discovery to use the new error handling system
   - Added safety wrappers for plugin operations with error collection

### Technical Details

#### Error Handling Architecture

The error handling system follows the Pragmatic Hexagonal Architecture pattern, separating core error domain models from external concerns:

- **Error Domain Models:**
  - `ParserErrorCode` - Enumeration of all possible error types
  - `ErrorSeverity` - Classification of error importance (INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
  - `ParserError` - Core error data structure with context, location, and traceback

- **Exception Hierarchy:**
  - `ParserException` - Base exception class for all parser-related errors
  - Specialized exceptions: `SyntaxParserException`, `ASTParseException`, `PluginException`, etc.

- **Functional Error Handling:**
  - `Result<T>` - Generic type representing either success (with value) or failure (with error)
  - `safe_parse_file()` - Utility for safely parsing files with comprehensive error reporting

#### Serialization System

The serialization system handles complex Python objects and circular references:

- **Circular Reference Handling:**
  - Uses object ID tracking to detect already-seen objects
  - Replaces circular references with reference markers in JSON output

- **Custom Type Handling:**
  - Support for Python's `dataclasses` with automatic field extraction
  - Special handling for `Path`, `datetime`, `enum.Enum`, and function objects
  - Registration system for custom type serializers

- **Integration with Data Models:**
  - All data models implement consistent `to_dict()` methods
  - Recursive serialization handles nested structures properly

### Next Steps

1. **Complete Integration with Parser Plugins:**
   - Update the AST, Astroid, and Inspect4py parser plugins to use the new error handling system
   - Add error handling to all critical parsing operations
   - Ensure all plugins properly serialize their results

2. **Implement Plugin Error Recovery:**
   - Add fallback strategies when plugins encounter errors
   - Implement graceful degradation when certain parser components fail

3. **Update Neo4j Exporter:**
   - Integrate error reporting in the Neo4j export process
   - Add error nodes to the knowledge graph schema
   - Ensure proper serialization of complex structures before Neo4j export

4. **Performance Optimization (Task 2.6):**
   - Implement caching for parsed ASTs and serialized results
   - Add parallel processing capabilities for large codebases
   - Create benchmarking tools to measure performance improvements

### Dependencies and Environment

- The error handling and serialization systems have no external dependencies beyond the standard library
- Integration with Neo4j still requires the official Neo4j driver and environment variables:
  - `NEO4J_URI`, `NEO4J_USER`, `NEO4J_PASSWORD`, `NEO4J_DATABASE`
- Current work follows the project's Pragmatic Hexagonal Architecture and AI Intent Tagging rules

### Open Issues and Challenges

1. Circular references in complex ASTs may still require additional testing and optimization
2. Error handling for the Neo4j export process needs additional work for large datasets
3. Proper integration of error handling with the CLI interface is pending

### Additional Notes

The implemented error handling and serialization systems will significantly improve the parser's robustness and usefulness for analyzing architectural issues in codebases like Inventory_scrape, where domain model duplication, exception proliferation, and business logic duplication have been identified as critical issues.
